# spotify-audio-features

To install:
* clone the repo
* python -m SimpleHTTPServer
* localhost:8000/

Notes:
* Selecting port 8000 is paramount, as only the callback html associated with 8000 is registered with Spotify Developer.
* We are sincerely hoping that at least one person in the teaching staff uses Spotify and owns or follows at least one playlist. If this isn't the case, please email me at joanne.jang {at} {our school domain}, since a user account is necessary to get audio features for tracks (sorry for the hassle :P)!
* If the OAuth seems "stuck," please refresh the page, select the drop-down on the upper right hand corner to log out, and then log back in.
